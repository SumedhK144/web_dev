    <h1>History of Computers</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>history of computers</strong> dates back to ancient times when humans used simple tools like the <em>abacus</em> for calculations. 
        Over the centuries, mechanical devices such as <b>Babbage's Analytical Engine</b> laid the foundation for modern computing. 
        In the <u>20th century</u>, the development of electronic computers revolutionized technology, starting with vacuum tube-based machines like the <mark>ENIAC</mark>. 
        The invention of <i>transistors</i> and later <b>microprocessors</b> led to the rise of personal computers, shaping the digital age we live in today.

    <p>
        The first generation of computers (1940-1956) used <b>vacuum tubes</b> and were massive, consuming a lot of electricity. The second generation (1956-1963) replaced vacuum tubes with <b>transistors</b>, making computers smaller, faster, and more efficient. The third generation (1964-1971) introduced <u>integrated circuits</u>, allowing for even more powerful machines.

    <p>
        In the <mark>1970s</mark>, the development of the microprocessor gave birth to personal computers. Companies like <b>IBM, Apple, and Microsoft</b> played a significant role in bringing computers into homes and businesses. The <i>1980s and 1990s</i> saw rapid advancements, including graphical user interfaces, networking, and the internet revolution.
